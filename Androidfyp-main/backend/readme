HTTP Request → Handler → Service → Repository → Database → Repository → Service → Handler → HTTP Response
Architecture Overview

Handlers receive API requests, perform basic input validation, and pass data to the service layer.

Models define data structure and use ORM (like GORM) to map database tables to code objects, making database operations simpler.

Service layer contains business logic, processing and validating data before calling the repository.

Repositories interact directly with the database, executing queries without adding business logic.

1. **Retrofit**

   * High-level library to make API calls easy.
   * Turns interface methods into HTTP requests.

2. **ApiService (Interface)**

   * Defines API endpoints with annotations (`@GET`, `@POST`).
   * Just a description; no real code.

3. **OkHttpClient**

   * The class that we take from it an instance that actually sends HTTP requests and receives responses.
   * Handles networking, retries, caching, interceptors.

4. **RetrofitClient**

   * Builds and configures Retrofit with base URL, converters, and OkHttpClient(instance).
   * Provides an `ApiService` instance.

5. **Interceptors**

  An interceptor is a component that intercepts (catches) every HTTP request before it’s sent to the server,
   and every HTTP response before it reaches your app code.
